# ProximalMethods

This is a package for minimization using proximal methods.

Provides proximal operator evaluation routines and proximal optimization algorithms, such as (accelerated) proximal gradient methods and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), for non-smooth/non-differentiable objective functions.
